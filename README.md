# Jamaican Creole Dictionary

This is a tool that generates a dictionary of [Jamaican Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Patois) words from [_Di Jamiekan Nyuu Testiment_](https://www.bible.com/versions/476-jnt-di-jamiekan-nyuu-testiment).

The tool scrapes the website for raw text and then inserts the words into a dictionary.

Future work involves using the dictionary as a spell checker for typing in Jamaican Creole and organizing the dictionary formally. A long term goal is to create a grammar checker using ideas in [_Speech and Language Processing_](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf), particularly chapter 12.
